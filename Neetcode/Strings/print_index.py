'''Implement the three functions on the right as follows:

print_first_char(word: str) -> None should print the first character of the word.
print_second_char(word: str) -> None should print the second character of the word.
print_last_char(word: str) -> None should print the last character of the word. (Hint: you will need the len() function.)
You may assume that every word passed into your functions will have at least two characters.'''
